Bitcoin’s nosedives continued in the past 24 hours, with the asset dropping to and below $21,000. The altcoins are also suffering, with Ethereum slumping by another $100 and more massive declines from Cardano, Solana, Shiba Inu, Polygon, and Avalanche. Bitcoin Down to a Weekly Low
It was less than a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency was riding high and tapped a 40-day peak of over $24,000. As news emerged that Tesla had sold a substantial portion of its BTC holdings, though, the asset lost $2,000.
