      Cardano hs been outperforming the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH) over the last few weeks and is already up 
      over 88% against it after making a recent low. Cardano’s performance is significant as it rivals Ethereum as a blockchain network that runs smart 
      contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</p><p>Cardano’s network has been steadli growing, with  over 5 million native assets have now 
      having been minted on top of the Cardano blockchain, doubling the figure seen at the end of last year. Over 1,000 projects are building on top of 
      the network.</p><p>It’s worth noting Cardano’s price has been rising ahead of the Vasil hard fork, which according to Cardano’s founder Charles 
      Hoskinson is expected to <a href="https://tradingview.com/symbols/BCBA-GBAN/news/">Cardano</a> bring a “massive performance improvement.” The crypto 
      community has recently predicted that the price of Cardano’s native

      will involve four CardanoImprovement Proposals (CIPs). The hard fork has already seen ADA outperform numerous other cryptocurrencies, even amid a 
      wider cryptocurrency market downturn exacerbated by the collapse of the <a href="https://tradingview.com/symbols/BCBA-GBAN/news/">Cardano</a> Terra 
      ecosystem. That performance saw ADA become the sixth-largest
